{[}introduction{]} Stomata are important

Stomatal ratio is important unsolved problem

Amphi leaves are more common in sunny habitats and confer a great
benefit. (this pattern is also true in Solanum? could we analyze
herbarium data here?)

{[}maybe make distinction between amphi leaves and var in SR here since
all tomato species are amphi{]}

Leaves with greater stomatal density ratio are more in open, sunny
habitats because they deliver the greatest benefit in those
circumstances. An amphistomatous leaf increases photosynthetic carbon
gain compared to an otherwise identical hypostomatous leaf by increasing
conductance through the leaf intercellular airspaces and boudary layers;
the additional water loss through a second boundary layer is typically
small {[}cites{]}. We quantify this benefit as the amphistomy advantage
(AA = log(Aamphi/Ahypo). Why would AA be greater in sun than shade?
There are three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses that we classify as
`acclimatory', `plastic', and `constitutive'.

Acclimatory hypothesis: Leaves acclimated to high light intensity
typically increase total leaf stomatal conductance (increased CO\$\_2\$
supply) and upregulate Rubisco activation (increased CO\$\emph{2\$}
demand). A one-dimensional circuit model using the Farquhar-von
Caemmerer-Berry biochemical model of C\$\_3\$ photosynthesis shows that
both increased stomatal conductance and Rubisco activity should increase
AA, all else being equal (Supporting Information). If the acclimatory
hypothesis is correct, we predict that AAhigh \textgreater{} AAlow for
all species regardless of native habitat or growth environment. Plants
adapted to sunny, open habitats will evolve greater stomatal density
ratio to take advantage of regular exposure to high light intensity.

Plastic hypothesis: Individuals of the same genotype often develop
dramatically different leaves in sun and shade conditions (cite).
Plastic responses are likely adaptations to optimize photosynthesis at
different light intensities (cites), but changes in leaf anatomy and
biochemistry could modulate AA as a byproduct. Thicker or less porous
leaves, both of which are associated with high leaf mass per area (LMA),
will have lower g\_ias; leaves with increased total stomatal density and
Rubisco concentration have greater potential CO2 supply and demand.
Under the plastic hypothesis, we predict that AAsun \textgreater{}
AAshade for all species and light intensities. AAsun and gsmax,sun
should be positively associated with native light habitat.
{[}transition{]} We assume that genotypes adapted to sunny, open
habitats will express a phenotype best adapted to that environment when
leaves develop under high light intensity; genotypes adapted to shaded
closed habitats may be plastic, but suboptimal for light intensities
they do not regularly experience in nature.

{[}conceptual figure could also show differential benefit of amphi
leaves in sun/shade{]}

to plants growing there. in those It has been hypothesized that
amphistomy increases photosynthesis more in sunny places. Three
nonmutually exclusive adaptive explanations for why amphi leaves:

Conceptual figure explaining each hypothesis

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  acclimation: greater demand, higher gs increase AA
\item
  developmental plasticity: light-induced changes in leaf anatomy
  modulate AA
\item
  constitutive: genetic differences in leaves adapted to different light
  habitats
\end{itemize}

We distinguished among these hypotheses by comparing AA among wild
tomato species from different native light habitats, grown under
simulated sun and shade light treatments, and measured under contrasting
light intensity (Figure of hypotheses and predictions). We measured AA
on 600 individual plants from 30 accessions (average of 10 replicates
per light treatment) using a recently developed method (\emph{1}). With
this method, we directly compare the photosynthetic rate of an untreated
amphistomatous leaf to that of the same leaf with gas exchange blocked
through the adaxial (upper) surface by transparent plastic, which we
refer to as `pseudohypostomy'. To compare amphi- and pseudohypostomatous
leaves at identical whole-leaf \(g_\text{sc}\), we measure \(A\) over a
range of \(g_\text{sc}\), inducing stomatal opening and closure by
modulating humidity (see Materials and Methods for further details).

of conceptual figure? in supplement?)

explaining why amphistomy advantage (AA) might be greater for leaves in
sunny, open habitats. For each hypothesis, we make predictions for how
native light habitat, light treatment, and light intensity would affect
AA.

{[}add rows for when multiple hypotheses are supported simultaneously?
or put that in SI?{]}

{[}results{]} Amphistomy increases \(A\) in all accessions, in both sun
and shade leaves, and light intensities. We infer this from the fact
that blocking gas exchange in pseudohypostomatous leaves reduced \(A\)
by X-X\% depending on the accession, light treatment, and light
intensity (Table/figure). The AA is equivalent to an X-X\% change in
total \(g_\text{sc}\) (see SI section gs equivalency). But whereas
increasing \(g_\text{sc}\) would increase water loss as a necessary
by-product, amphistomy can increase \(A\) without any appreciable affect
on transpiration.

Sun leaves from high light habitats {[}not sure if htis result is true
yet{]} benefit the most from amphistomy because of a both developmental
plasticity and constitutive differences among accessions. {[}quantify
difference in AA and contribution of different affects{]}. Surprisingly,
light intensity had a little effect\ldots{} (should this be in this
paragraph, or it's own?).

{[}discussion{]} - sun/shade has long been appreciated and this shows
new trait that should be considered and that CO2 diffusion becomes major
limitation

\hypertarget{accessions}{%
\subsubsection{Accessions}\label{accessions}}

We compared AA among 30 ecologically diverse accessions of wild tomato,
including representatives of all described species of \emph{Solanum}
sect. \emph{Lycopersicon} and sect. \emph{Lycopersicoides} (\emph{2})
and the cultivated tomato \emph{S. lycopersicum} var.
\emph{lycopersicum} (tab:accessions). Due to constraints on growth space
and time, we spread out measurements over 80 weeks from May 1, 2022 to
October 31, 2023. Replicates within accession were evenly spread out
over this period to prevent confounding of temporal variation in growth
conditions with accession. {[}anything else to say here? maybe explain
accession selection and phylogeny?{]}

\begin{table}

\end{table}

\hypertarget{plant-growth-conditions}{%
\subsubsection{Plant growth conditions}\label{plant-growth-conditions}}

In all growth spaces, we recorded \(\mathrm{PPFD}\) using full spectrum
quantum sensors (SQ-500-SS, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA); we
recorded temperature, RH, and {[}CO\(_2\){]} using an EE894 sensor (E+E
Elektronik, Engerwitzdorf, Austria) protected by a radiation shield. All
environmental measurements were taken every 10 minutes from the middle
of plants racks at approximately the same height as the leaves we
measured. We measured leaf temperature of focal leaves prior to
measurement using an infrared radiometer (SI-111-SS, Apogee Instruments,
Logan, Utah, USA).

\hypertarget{germination-and-seedling-stage}{%
\paragraph{Germination and seedling
stage}\label{germination-and-seedling-stage}}

Seeds provided by the Tomato Genetics Resource Center germinated on
moist paper in plastic boxes after soaking for 30-60 minutes in a 50\%
(volume per volume) solution of household bleach and water, followed by
a thorough rinse. We transferred seedlings to cell-pack flats containing
Pro-Mix BX potting mix (Premier Tech, Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, Canada)
once cotyledons fully emerged, typically within 1-2 weeks of sowing. We
grew seeds and seedlings for both sun and shade treatments under the
same environmental conditions (12:12 h, 25:\(\qty{20}{\degreeCelsius}\),
40:60 RH day:night cycle). LED light provided
\(\mathrm{PPFD} = \qty{200}{\micro\mol\raiseto{-2}\meter\raiseto{-1}\second}\)
(Fluence RAZRx, Austin, Texas, USA).

\hypertarget{light-treatments}{%
\paragraph{Light treatments}\label{light-treatments}}

Seedlings were randomly assigned in alternating order within accession
to the sun or shade treatment during transplanting. After seedlings
established in cell-pack flats for \(\approx 2\) weeks, we transplanted
them to 3.78 L plastic pots containing 60\% Pro-Mix BX potting mix, 20\%
coral sand (Pro-Pak, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, USA), and 20\% cinders (Niu
Nursery, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, USA). Percentage composition is on a volume
basis. The soil mixture contained slow release NPK fertilizer following
manufacturer instructions (Osmocote Smart-Release Plant Food Flower \&
Vegetable, The Scotts Company, Marysville, Ohio, USA). We determined pot
field capacity one week after transplanting using a scale (Ohaus V12P15
Valor 1000, Parsippany, New Jersey, USA) and watered to field capacity
three times per week to prevent drought stress.

We assigned sun and shade treatment to lower and upper racks of a
\(\qty{1.22}{\meter} \times \qty{2.44}{\meter}\) shelving unit in a
climate-controlled growth room. We assigned the sun treatment to the
lower rack to limit diffuse light from reaching the shade treatment. The
average daytime \ppfd{} was \ppfdequals{800}
(\(\qty{800}{\micro\mol\raiseto{-2}\meter\raiseto{-1}\second}\)) and
\ppfdequals{125}
(\(\qty{125}{\micro\mol\raiseto{-2}\meter\raiseto{-1}\second}\)) for sun
and shade treatments, respectively. To isolate the effect of light
intensity from quality, we used the same LED model with the the same
spectrum (Fluence SPYDR 2i, Austin, Texas, USAS), but dimmed the lights
in the shade treatment. To maintain homogeneous environmental conditions
other than light, we mixed air within the growth room using an air
circulator (Vornado 693DC, Andover, Kansas, USA) and within racks using
a miniature oscillating air circulator (Vornado Atom 1, Andover, Kansas,
USA). Despite these efforts, the air in the sun treatment was on average
\(\qty{1}{\degreeCelsius}\) warmer and the average RH was consequently 5
lower. However, because of evaporative cooling, the leaves in the sun
treatment were only \(\qty{1}{\degreeCelsius}\) on average (\(n = 600\)
leaves).

\hypertarget{leaf-trait-measurements}{%
\subsubsection{Leaf trait measurements}\label{leaf-trait-measurements}}

We selected a fully expanded, unshaded leaf at least six leaves above
the cotyledons during early vegetative growth. This typically meant that
plants had grown in light treatments for \(\approx\) 4 weeks, ensuring
they had time to sense and respond developmentally to the light
intensity of the treatment rather than the seedling conditions
(\emph{3}). Shade plants grew slower than sun plants, hence leaves at
the same developmental stage were measured on chronologically older
plants in the shade treatment. In some sun plants, we had to use leaves
higher on the stem because short internodes made lower leaves
inaccessible with the gas exchange equipment. We measured terminal
leaflets in 70.0\% of cases, but used the lateral leaflet closest to the
terminal leaflet when it was damaged or difficult to clamp into the gas
exchange chamber. When a leaflet was damaged during gas exchange
measurements, we collected anatomical data from the nearest leaflet on
the same leaf (10.0)\%. We measured chlorophyll concentration index
(CCI) using a chrolophyll concentration meter (MC-100, Apogee
Instruments, Logan, Utah, USA) on the lamina of focal leaflets before
gas exchange measurements at the same time we measured leaf temperature.

\hypertarget{amphistomy-advantage}{%
\paragraph{Amphistomy advantage}\label{amphistomy-advantage}}

We estimated `amphistomy advantage' (\aax) \emph{sensu} (\emph{4}), but
with modifications previously described in (\emph{1}). \aax{} is
calculated as the log-response ratio of \(A\) compared at the same total
\gsw:

\[\mathrm{AA} = \mathrm{log}(A_{\mathrm{amphi}} / A_{\mathrm{hypo}})\]

We measured the photosynthetic rate of an untreated amphistomatous leaf
(\Aamphi) over a range of \gsw{} values. We refer to this as an
\agcurve{} curve. We compared the \agcurve{} curve of the untreated leaf
to the photosynthetic rate of pseudohypostomatous leaf (\Ahypo), which
is the same leaf but with gas exchange through the upper surface blocked
by a neutral density plastic (propafilm).

We measured \agcurve{} curves using a portable infrared gas analyzer
(LI-6800PF, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA).
Light-acclimated plants were placed under LEDs dimmed to match their
light treatment during gas exchange measurements. We estimated the
photosynthetic rate (\(A\)) and stomatal conductance to CO\(_2\) (\gsw)
at ambient CO\(_2\) (\caequals{415}) and \tleafequals{25.0}. The
irradiance of the light source in the pseudohypo leaf was higher because
the propafilm reduces transmission. To compensate for reduced
transmission, we increased incident \ppfd for pseudohypo leaves by a
factor 1/0.91, the inverse of the measured transmissivity of the
propafilm. We also set the stomatal conductance ratio, for purposes of
calculating boundary layer conductance, to 0 for pseudohypo leaves
following manufacturer directions.

We collected four \agcurve{} curves per leaf, an amphi (untreated) curve
and a pseudohypo (treated) curve at high light-intensity
(\ppfdequals{2000}; 97.7:2.3 red:blue) and low light-intensity
(\ppfdequals{150}; 87.0:13.0 red:blue). We always measured high
light-intensity curves first because photosynthetic downregulation is
faster than upregulation in these species. To control for order effects,
we alternated between starting with amphi or pseudohypo leaf
measurements. Unlike (\emph{1}), preliminary experiments with
\emph{Solanum} indicated a strong order effect in that \(A\) declined in
the second curve. Therefore, we made measurements over two days. On the
first day, we measured high and low light-intensity curves for either
amphi or pseudohypo leaves; on the second day, we measured high and low
light-intensity curves on the other leaf type.

In all cases, we acclimated the focal leaf to high light
(\ppfdequals{2000}) and high relative humidity (\rhequals{70}) until
\(A\) and \gsw{} reach their maximum. After that, we decreased \rh{} to
\(\approx 10\%\) to induce rapid stomatal closure without biochemical
downregulation. Hence, \Aamphi{} and \Ahypo{} were both measured at low
chamber humidity after the leaf had acclimated to high humidity. All
other environmental conditions in the leaf chamber remained the same. We
logged data until \gsw{} reached its nadir. We then acclimated the leaf
to low light (\ppfdequals{150}) and \rhequals{70} before inducing
stomatal closure with low \rh and logging data as described above.

\hypertarget{light-response-curves}{%
\paragraph{Light-response curves}\label{light-response-curves}}

In 90.0\% of plants, we measured light-response curves on the same
leaflets as \agcurve{} curves. However, when a leaflet was damaged
during \agcurve{} curves, we used the next closest leaflet for
light-response curves. Leaves acclimated to high light-intensity
(\ppfdequals{2000}), ambient CO\(_2\) (\caequals{415}), \rhequals{50},
and \tleafequals{25}. After \(A\) and \gsw{} stabilized, we measured
\(A\) at 20 light-intensity levels between \(0\) and
\(\qty{2000}{\micro\mol\raiseto{-2}\meter\raiseto{-1}\second}\) in
descending order.

\hypertarget{stomatal-anatomy}{%
\paragraph{Stomatal anatomy}\label{stomatal-anatomy}}

We estimated the stomatal density and size on ab- and adaxial leaf
surfaces from all leaves, using guard cell length as a proxy for
stomatal size since it proportional to maximum conductance (\emph{5}).
We made surface impressions of leaf lamina from the same area used for
gas exchange measurements using a-silicone impression material (Zhermack
elite HD+, light body, fast set, Rovigo, Italy). We applied clear nail
polish to make positive replicas of the impression. After nail polish
dried, we mounted replicas on a microscope slide using transparent tape
(\emph{6}). We digitized a portion of each leaf surface replica using a
brightfield microscope (Leica DM2000, Wetzlar, Germany). We counted and
measured guard cell length on all stomata using the FIJI implementation
of ImageJ2 version 2.3.0 (\emph{7}), then divided the count by the
visible leaf area (\(\qty{0.890}{\raiseto{2}\milli\meter}\)) to estimate
stomatal density.

\hypertarget{leaf-mass-per-area}{%
\paragraph{Leaf mass per area}\label{leaf-mass-per-area}}

Leaf mass per area (LMA) is the dry mass divided by the leaflet area. We
scanned fresh leaflets on a flat bed scanner (Epson V600, Los Alamitos,
California. USA) and measured leaflet area from digital images using the
FIJI implementation of ImageJ2 version 2.3.0 (\emph{7}). We dried leaves
for 72 hours at \(\qty{74}{\degreeCelsius}\) in a food dehydrator
(Cosori CP267-FD, Vesync Co., Anaheim, California, USA) and weighed
using a benchtop analytical balance (Ohaus PR64 Analytical Balance,
Parsippany, New Jersey, USA). In \(5.0\%\) we measured LMA on the
adjacent leaflet because the focal leaflet was damaged or wilted while
making surface impressions and we could not reliably estimate area. LMA
data are missing from \(3.0\%\) of individuals because the area or mass
was not recorded at all or recorded incorrectly.

\end{itemize}

We fit Bayesian models using the \emph{R} package \textbf{brms} version
2.20.4 (\emph{9}) with MCMC sampling in \emph{Stan} version XXX

(\emph{12}). We sampled the posterior distribution from 4 chains with
1000 iterations each after 1000 warmup iterations per chain. We
estimated parameters and confidence intervals as the median and 95\%
quantile intervals of the posterior, respectively.
