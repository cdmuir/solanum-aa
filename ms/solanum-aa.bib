	abstract = {SummaryPlant leaves provide the following main functions: (1) light interception and utilization of light energy for photosynthesis. This includes efficient light absorption under low and moderate light, while reducing excess light absorption under high light. (2) Incorporating CO2 as the substrate of photosynthesis, while limiting the amount of water lost. (3) Maintaining a stable internal environment for physiological processes by modulating leaf temperature. (4) Maintaining structural integrity that allows leaves to photosynthesize under various mechanical stresses such as gravity, wind, rainfall and herbivory. (5) Transporting water, photosynthates, and nutrients to realize efficient functioning of the plant and the leaf.Subjected to both anatomical and environmental constraints, natural selection has resulted in an intricate leaf anatomy that balances the above functions and allows plants to grow and produce progeny. As a result, plants coordinate size, number, shape, and arrangement of cells, adjust the thickness and chemical composition of cell walls, and utilize physical phenomena such as water evaporation, refraction, and reflection of light.In the present chapter, common features of leaf anatomy are described and the current knowledge related to its functions is summarized. Special emphasis will be given to leaf optical properties, gas diffusion, water transport, and mechanical properties. Acclimation and adaptation of leaf anatomy in response to environmental conditions will be reviewed. In addition, we will discuss the physiological mechanisms and ecological significance of these responses.},

Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the larger number of stomata in sun-leaves. These will be considered later, but we may note here the apparent discrepancy with the observations of Ziegeler that the leaves of the more xerophytic Carices possess fewer stomata than the leaves of those species characteristic of damper habitats.

                  Although stomata are typically found in greater numbers on the abaxial surface, wheat flag leaves have greater densities on the adaxial surface. We determine the impact of this less common stomatal patterning on gaseous fluxes using a novel chamber that simultaneously measures both leaf surfaces.
                
                
                  
                    Using a combination of differential illuminations and CO
                    2
                    concentrations at each leaf surface, we found that mesophyll cells associated with the adaxial leaf surface have a higher photosynthetic capacity than those associated with the abaxial leaf surface, which is supported by an increased stomatal conductance (driven by differences in stomatal density).
                  
                
                
                  When vertical gas flux at the abaxial leaf surface was blocked, no compensation by adaxial stomata was observed, suggesting each surface operates independently. Similar stomatal kinetics suggested some co‐ordination between the two surfaces, but factors other than light intensity played a role in these responses.
                
                
                  
                    Higher photosynthetic capacity on the adaxial surface facilitates greater carbon assimilation, along with higher adaxial stomatal conductance, which would also support greater evaporative leaf cooling to maintain optimal leaf temperatures for photosynthesis. Furthermore, abaxial gas exchange contributed

            Editor’s summary
            The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a fundamental driver of climate, but its value is difficult to determine for times older than the roughly 800,000 years for which ice core records are available. The Cenozoic Carbon dioxide Proxy Integration Project (CenCO2PIP) Consortium assessed a comprehensive collection of proxy determinations to define the atmospheric carbon dioxide record for the past 66 million years. This synthesis provides the most complete record yet available and will help to better establish the role of carbon dioxide in climate, biological, and cryosphere evolution. —H. Jesse Smith

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO
                2
                ) emissions have driven an increase in the global atmospheric CO
                2
                concentration from 280 parts per million (ppm) before industrialization to an annual average of 419 ppm in 2022, corresponding to an increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) of 1.1°C over the same period. If global CO
                2
                emissions continue to rise, atmospheric CO
                2
                could exceed 800 ppm by the year 2100. This begs the question of where our climate is headed. The geologic record is replete with both brief and extended intervals of CO
                2
                concentration higher than today and thus provides opportunities to project the response of the future climate system to increasing CO
                2
                . For example, it has been estimated that global surface temperature 50 million years ago (Ma) was {\textasciitilde}12°C higher than today, in tandem with atmospheric CO
                2
                concentrations some 500 ppm higher (i.e., more than doubled) than present-day values. Consistent with these estimates, Antarctica and Greenland were free of ice at that time. However, reconstructing these values prior to direct instrumental measurements requires the use of paleoproxies—measurable properties of geological archives that are closely, but only indirectly, related to the parameter in question (e.g., temperature, CO
                2
                ). To date, at least eight different proxies from both terrestrial and marine archives have been developed and applied to reconstruct paleo-CO
                2
                , but their underlying assumptions have been revised over time, and published reconstructions are not always consistent. This uncertainty complicates quantification of the climate responses to the ongoing rise of atmospheric CO
                2
                concentrations.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Although earlier studies have compiled published paleo-CO
                2
                estimates, those studies typically applied only limited proxy vetting, included estimates that were made before the proxies were sufficiently validated, and/or focused on only a subset of available proxy data. The international consortium of the Cenozoic CO
                2
                Proxy Integration Project (CenCO
                2
                PIP) has undertaken a 7-year effort to document, evaluate, and synthesize published paleo-CO
                2
                records from all available archives, spanning the past 66 million years. The most reliable CO
                2
                estimates were identified, some records were recalculated to conform with the latest proxy understanding, age models were updated where necessary and possible, and data were categorized according to the community’s level of confidence in each estimate. The highest-rated data were eventually combined into a reconstruction of the Cenozoic history of atmospheric CO
                2
                .
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                The resulting reconstruction illustrates a more quantitatively robust relationship between CO
                2
                and global surface temperature, yielding greater clarity and confidence than previous syntheses. The new record suggests that early Cenozoic “hothouse” CO
                2
                concentrations peaked around 1600 ppm at {\textasciitilde}51 Ma. Near 33.9 Ma, the onset of continent-wide Antarctic glaciation coincided with an atmospheric CO
                2
                concentration of 720 ppm. By {\textasciitilde}32 Ma, atmospheric CO
                2
                had dropped to 550 ppm, and this value coincided with the onset of radiation in plants with carbon-concentrating mechanisms that populate grasslands and deserts today. CO
                2
                remained below this threshold for the remainder of the Cenozoic and continued its long-term decrease toward the present. Along this trajectory, the middle Miocene ({\textasciitilde}16 Ma) marks the last time that CO
                2
                concentrations were consistently higher than at present; Greenland was not yet glaciated at that time, and independent estimates suggest that sea level was some 50 m higher than today. Values eventually dropped below 270 ppm at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary (2.6 Ma), when Earth approached our current “icehouse” state of bipolar glaciation. This and other climatic implications of the revised CO
                2
                curve, including the evolution of the cryosphere, flora, and fauna, along with the cross-disciplinary data assessment process, are detailed in the full online article.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                This community-vetted CO
                2
                synthesis represents the most reliable data available to date and a means to improve our understanding of past changes in global climate and carbon cycling as well as organismal evolution. However, this effort is still incomplete. Data remain sparse during the earlier part of the record and in some instances are dominated by estimates from a single proxy system. Generating a paleo-CO
                2
                record with even greater confidence will require further research using multiple proxies to fill in data gaps and increase overall data resolution, resolve discrepancies between estimates from contemporaneous proxy analyses, reduce uncertainty of established methods, and develop new proxies.

              Premise
              The adaptive significance of amphistomy (stomata on both upper and lower leaf surfaces) is unresolved. A widespread association between amphistomy and open, sunny habitats suggests the adaptive benefit of amphistomy may be greatest in these contexts, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Understanding amphistomy informs its potential as a target for crop improvement and paleoenvironment reconstruction.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We developed a method to quantify “amphistomy advantage” () as the log‐ratio of photosynthesis in an amphistomatous leaf to that of the same leaf but with gas exchange blocked through the upper surface (pseudohypostomy). Humidity modulated stomatal conductance and thus enabled comparing photosynthesis at the same total stomatal conductance. We estimated  and leaf traits in six coastal (open, sunny) and six montane (closed, shaded) populations of the indigenous Hawaiian species ʻilima (
                Sida fallax
                ).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Coastal ʻilima leaves benefit 4.04 times more from amphistomy than montane leaves. Evidence was equivocal with respect to two hypotheses: (1) that coastal leaves benefit more because they are thicker and have lower CO
                2
                conductance through the internal airspace and (2) that they benefit more because they have similar conductance on each surface, as opposed to most conductance being through the lower surface.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                This is the first direct experimental evidence that amphistomy increases photosynthesis, consistent with the hypothesis that parallel pathways through upper and lower mesophyll increase CO
                2
                supply to chloroplasts. The prevalence of amphistomatous leaves in open, sunny habitats can partially be explained by the increased benefit of amphistomy in “sun” leaves, but the mechanistic basis remains uncertain.},

The presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, termed amphistomy, increases photosynthetic rate, is common in plants from high light habitats, and rare otherwise. In this study I use optimality models based on leaf energy budget and photosynthetic models to ask why amphistomy is common in high light habitats. I developed an R package leafoptimizer to solve for stomatal traits that optimally balance carbon gain with water loss in a given environment. The model predicts that amphistomy is common in high light because its marginal effect on carbon gain is greater than in the shade, but only if the costs of amphistomy are also lower under high light than in the shade. More generally, covariation between costs and benefits may explain why stomatal and other traits form discrete phenotypic clusters.},

In particular, natural selection may only favour a narrow range of adaptive optima constrained within selective regimes. Here, I integrate data with theory to test whether selection explains phenotypic constraint. A global database of 599 plant species from 94 families shows that stomatal ratio, a trait affecting photosynthesis and defence against pathogens, is highly constrained. Most plants have their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but species with half their stomata on each surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. A model based on a trade-off between maximizing photosynthesis and a fitness cost of upper stomata predicts a limited number of adaptive solutions, leading to a multimodal trait distribution. Phylogenetic comparisons show that amphistomy is the most common among fast-growing species, supporting the view that CO

              diffusion is under strong selection. These results indicate that selective optima stay within a relatively stable set of selective regimes over macroevolutionary time.},

	abstract = {In most plants, stomata are located only on the abaxial leaf surface (hypostomy), but many plants have stomata on both surfaces (amphistomy). High light and herbaceous growth form have been hypothesized to favor amphistomy, but these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested together using phylogenetic comparative methods. I leveraged a large dataset including stomatal ratio, Ellenberg light indicator value, growth form and phylogenetic relationships for 372 species of British angiosperms. I used phylogenetic comparative methods to test how light and/or growth form influence stomatal ratio and density. High light and herbaceous growth form are correlated with amphistomy, as predicted, but they also interact; the effect of light is pronounced in therophytes (annuals) and perennial herbs, but muted in phanerophytes (shrubs and trees). Furthermore, amphistomy and stomatal density evolve together in response to light. Comparative analyses of British angiosperms reveal two major insights. First, light and growth form interact to shape stomatal ratio; amphistomy is common under high light, but mostly for herbs. Second, coordinated evolution of adaxial stomatal density and light tolerance indicates that amphistomy helps to optimally balance light acquisition with gas exchange. Stomatal ratio may have potential as a functional trait for paleoecology and crop improvement.},

              Dissecting plant responses to the environment is key to understanding whether and how plants adapt to anthropogenic climate change. Stomata, plants’ pores for gas exchange, are expected to decrease in density following increased CO

              concentrations, a trend already observed in multiple plant species. However, it is unclear whether such responses are based on genetic changes and evolutionary adaptation.

              Arabidopsis thaliana
              historical herbarium specimens collected over 193 years to directly link genetic variation with climate change. While we find that the essential transcription factors SPCH, MUTE and FAMA, central to stomatal development, are under strong evolutionary constraints, several regulators of stomatal development show signs of local adaptation in contemporary samples from different geographic regions. We then develop a functional score based on known effects of gene knock-out on stomatal development that recovers a classic pattern of stomatal density decrease over the past centuries, suggesting a genetic component contributing to this change. This approach combining historical genomics with functional experimental knowledge could allow further investigations of how different, even in historical samples unmeasurable, cellular plant phenotypes may have already responded to climate change through adaptive evolution.},

            Stomata, microscopic pores flanked by symmetrical guard cells, are vital regulators of gas exchange that link plant processes with environmental dynamics. The formation of stomata involves the multi-step progression of a specialized cell lineage. Remarkably, this process is heavily influenced by environmental factors, allowing plants to adjust stomatal production to local conditions. With global warming set to alter our climate at an unprecedented pace, understanding how environmental factors impact stomatal development and plant fitness is becoming increasingly important. In this Review, we focus on the effects of carbon dioxide, high temperature and drought – three environmental factors tightly linked to global warming – on stomatal development. We summarize the stomatal response of a variety of plant species and highlight the existence of species-specific adaptations. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we also provide an update on the molecular mechanisms involved in mediating the plasticity of stomatal development. Finally, we explore how knowledge on stomatal development is being applied to generate crop varieties with optimized stomatal traits that enhance their resilience against climate change and maintain agricultural productivity.},

also assessed indirectly with hemispherical fisheye photographs, plant canopy analysis, 38-mm photographs, 24-mm 
photographs and a spherical densiometer. Estimates from all indirect methods, except the spherical densiometer, were 
highly correlated with the direct measurements. Short-term direct light measurements for a day or a week also
correlated with long-term light conditions. The indirect measures differed by up to
              c
              . 70\% from the direct measures relative 
to single site measurements. Hence, the indirect methods are inadequate where single site light conditions have to be 
assessed accurately. However, because light conditions encountered in the understorey varied up to 13-fold, the indirect 
methods were found to be well suited to rank understorey light conditions among a large number of sites. The results 
from frequent and infrequent sampling schedules differed only slightly, suggesting that taking indirect measures at the 
beginning and the end of a study offers a reasonable compromise between accuracy and sampling effort.},

              Premise
              Amphistomy, the presence of stomata on both leaf surfaces, can increase photosynthesis yet is uncommon across vascular plants. The relative infrequency of amphistomy is often attributed to high costs, such as transpirational water loss. The Florida scrub—a hot, dry, shrub‐dominated habitat—historically has experienced frequent fire, yet decades of anthropogenic suppression coupled with the reintroduction of prescribed burns has led to varied fire regimes. In this study, we investigated the links between amphistomy and fire with regard to the presence of the trait across species in this pyrogenic habitat and within‐species variation before and after experimental fire and across a time‐since‐fire gradient (0.25–50 years).
            
            
              Methods
              
                We surveyed the presence of amphistomy for 116 plant species across scrub habitats and experimentally investigated intraspecific variation in stomatal traits for two amphistomatous, post‐fire resprouting species of palmetto,
                Serenoa repens
                and
                Sabal etonia
                (Arecaceae).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Amphistomy was present in 62.9\% of all surveyed species and 85.7\% of post‐fire obligate reseeders, suggesting amphistomy may be particularly beneficial in this group and broadly in the Florida scrub conditions. The stomatal ratio (upper/total stomatal density) was generally stable within and across individuals of both species after fire. Stomatal density decreased following fire in
                S. etonia
                , with both species experiencing high variation in the post‐fire years.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Amphistomy is common in the Florida scrub and relatively stable within species in response to fire, while stomatal density responds plastically during post‐fire recovery.},

              Leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) is a central trait in ecology, but its anatomical and compositional basis has been unclear. An explicit mathematical and physical framework for quantifying the cell and tissue determinants of LMA will enable tests of their influence on species, communities and ecosystems. We present an approach to explaining LMA from the numbers, dimensions and mass densities of leaf cells and tissues, which provided unprecedented explanatory power for 11 broadleaved woody angiosperm species diverse in LMA (33–262 g m

Across these diverse species, and in a larger comparison of evergreen vs. deciduous angiosperms, high LMA resulted principally from larger cell sizes, greater major vein allocation, greater numbers of mesophyll cell layers and higher cell mass densities. This explicit approach enables relating leaf anatomy and composition to a wide range of processes in physiological, evolutionary, community and macroecology.},

The model includes intercellular space resistances to CO2 uptake via both the upper and lower surfaces. Experimental data obtained with Pelargonium hortorum Bailey show that the ratio of the rates of C02 exchange through the lower and upper surfaces respectively is in all cases greater than the ratio of the corresponding rates of water vapour exchange. This provides evidence for a substantial vapour phase resistance to C02 uptake via the upper epidermis, which is not accounted for by the usual water vapour analogue. The data also suggest that calculations of intracellular resistance r'i, using conventional resistance models, may be subject to error. How-ever, the magnitude of the error in estimates of the intracellular resistance is seldom likely to exceed 10\%, so that for most purposes changes in the conventional models do not appear to be warranted.},
